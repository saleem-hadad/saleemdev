Software engineer with a product mindset and endless passion for technology. I enjoy working with humans to build scalable and high-quality software for humans. I love building products, microservices, and open-source projects.

Outside work, I read about tech, finance, and neurology, and sometimes play guitar 🎸. If you lost me, you'll find me playing and learning with my daughter ❤️👸
